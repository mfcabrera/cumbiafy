# Cumbia.fy - Make your music sounds more cumbiambera.


Make a song sounds a bit more cumbia
Originally planned as a small demo for a music Hacking event in Munich in Summer 2012.
However my HD died that day, so I couln't show it.

I based my code on  [More Cowbel](http://example.com/)  code of the
[Echonest Remix](http://echonest.github.io/remix/)
[samples](http://echonest.github.io/remix/examples.html).

Requires [Echonest Remix](http://echonest.github.io/remix/) and Python.
